## Acknowledgments

This repository consists of many courses I took in the past year. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the following instructors for their invaluable guidance and teaching in helping me develop my coding skills:

- [Marc Scarfone](links to be updated): I enjoyed your every class. Your passion to effective communication and learning, compassion to each student help me build my strength in the learning, which also contributes substantially for learning any new skill in coding. 

- [Michael Crocker](links to be updated): Thank you for your patience and expertise in explaining complex concepts and providing practical examples that greatly enhanced my understanding in HTML, CSS, and C programming. You answer all my questions and share your knowledge on trouble shooting in environment setting, coding, deployment, which helped broad my knowledge and build my confidence in becoming a coder. 

- [Michael Trumbull](links to be updated): I am grateful to learn how to use tools such as Figma, Coolers, Unsplash, and Bootstrap in your course, it makes it much easier to front end work. Your constructive feedback and insightful critiques have helped me refine my design sensibilities and improve my problem-solving abilities. 

- [Geoff Gillespie](links to be updated): We are lucky to have you as our Python and Database course! Your passion to coding and energetic way of teaching have greatly influenced my growth in Python and Database management. I enjoy your hand-on follow up coding in the class, which made the learning process both engaging and enjoyable. 

- [Yousef Abu Baker](links to be updated): I appreciate you feedback on every assignment and excercise, I will think of your comment "You are a great coder." when every time I doubt myself if I can make it to a developer.They are invaluable in shaping my coding journey.

- They might not see above but I am happy I will save my time for graduation. lol
